# Github Candidate Search Website
Use this to look over a random selection of Github users, and choose to either add them to a list of candidates, or pass on them and see the next user in line.
From the 'Saved Candidates' Page, you can see a table of candidates you've selected, and you can further whittle down the competition by removing users from the list as you change your mind.
